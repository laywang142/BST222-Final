# Conclusion  

As shown by the multiple single-variate models, the mother's race, smoking status, and years of education played a role in determining whether or not they weaned their child. While performing the analysis, the correlation between poverty status and the race of the mother had to be considered. Because the data is from the 70s, it makes sense, intuitively, that race is associated with poverty status. Therefore, the poverty status appears to be significant when considered in a model with race but rather insignificant otherwise. Additionally, smoking status was also slightly correlated with race but not to the same extent. To take these relationships into account, the conclusions regarding the associations between smoking status and race with breastfeeding duration were drawn from hazard ratios from separate models. This was so we could have the most accurate final results. `yschool` was rather significant in the "full" model but it was also important to consider it within the context of the mother's age. The age of the mother and her years of education have a non-randomly correlated relationship. A person cannot have more years of education than she is old. However, in the context of this analysis, the age of the mother didn't appear to be a significant influence on breastfeeding duration on its own or in tandem with the years of education.
