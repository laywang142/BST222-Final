# Conclusion  

As shown by the multiple single-variate models, the mother's race, smoking status, and years of education played a role in determining whether or not they weaned their child. While performing the analysis, the correlation between poverty status and the race of the mother had to be considered. Because the data is from the 70s, it makes sense, intuitively, that race is associated with poverty status. Therefore, the poverty status appears to be significant when considered in a model with race but rather insignificant otherwise. Additionally, smoking status was also slightly correlated with race but not to the same extent. To take these relationships into account, the conclusions regarding the associations between smoking status and race with breastfeeding duration were drawn from hazard ratios from separate models. This was so we could have the most accurate final results. `yschool` was rather significant in the "full" model but it was also important to consider it within the context of the mother's age. The age of the mother and her years of education have a non-randomly correlated relationship. A person cannot have more years of education than she is old. However, in the context of this analysis, the age of the mother didn't appear to be a significant influence on breastfeeding duration on its own or in tandem with the years of education. Generally, it can be concluded that smoking mothers tend to wean their children faster than non-smoking mothers and that non-white mothers had a tendency to wean sooner than white mothers. The final values are shown in Tables \@ref(tab:race_model), \@ref(tab:smoke_model), and \@ref(tab:school_model). 

## Discussion  

There are a few possible explanations for the results. First of all, in regards to the trends with the smokers versus non-smokers, previous research has shown that smoking mothers' breast milk tends to dry up sooner than smoking mothers. This can can essentially force them too wean their child after a certain point as they can no longer provide any breast milk. 

While there are general trends being observed, there isn't enough data to make strong conclusions about the causes of the trends as cox models can only show associations.  

Because breastfeeding is largely beneficial for infants and their development, further research into the the main limitations mothers face when deciding how long to breastfeed their children could be beneficial. Stronger causal associations could help lawmakers and such adjust or create legislation that helps give mothers the accommodations they need to be able to raise a healthy generation of children.
